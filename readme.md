# Overview 
This package was forked from an abandoned package - `lego-mobile-nav` - which would not compile with Node.js 20 and Dart Sass.

The intention is to keep functionality the same, but support newer build tools.

Original Repo - https://github.com/lego-js/mobile-nav

This package will not accept pull requests. It is only used for compatibility with some of our long-running projects.

## Installation
New package name: `@union/lego-mobile-nav`
